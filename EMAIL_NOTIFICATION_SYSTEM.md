   - Security alert to admin
   - Timestamp and device information

## 🚀 Implementation Details

### Email Templates
The email service creates professional HTML emails with:
- **Gradient headers** with PG Wale Bhaiya branding
- **Structured information** tables
- **Call-to-action buttons** linking to dashboard/admin panel
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Security notices** for login confirmations

### Admin Dashboard Integration
- **Real-time notifications** when landlords register/login
- **Detailed landlord information** in admin emails
- **Direct links** to admin dashboard for quick action

### Error Handling
- **Graceful fallbacks** - Registration/login still works if email fails
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging email issues
- **Email configuration validation** on startup

## 📋 Testing

### Test Email Service (Backend)
```bash
cd backend
node test-email.js
```

### Test Frontend Changes
1. **Approved PGs Display**:
   - Visit `/listings` page
   - Should show only approved PGs
   - Filter and search should work

2. **Admin Landlord Management**:
   - Visit admin dashboard → Landlords tab
   - Click eye button on any landlord
   - Check joining date is displayed correctly

3. **Login/Signup Flow**:
   - Try logging in or signing up as a landlord
   - Should see success message about email notifications
   - No WhatsApp popup should appear

## 🔧 Configuration

```env
# Email Configuration
